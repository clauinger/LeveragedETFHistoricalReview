This is a web site/app built for the purpose of reviewing the past performince of an assortment of leveraged Exchange Traded Funds. It compares a selected levereaged ETF with it's non-leveraged counterpart (benchmark) over a range of time. These are charted and calculated using weekly closing prices.

Leveraged ETFs are reset on a daily market close basis. This presents very unique risk/reward characteristics. Holding a 3x leveraged ETF, for longer than one day, can be very much different than holding three times the cost purchase of a its non-leveraged counterpart.
